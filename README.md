# SeeFood: See food before you order!

## Inspiration
When you order food online, a lot of the times you are scared or hesitant to step out of your comfort zone; whether it is because you don't want to regret a purchase, or you do not remember the name of an exotic dish, SeeFood is there for your assurance and satisfaction.

## What it does
Our app scans a QR code, which transfers menu data from a restaurant website to our mobile app. Users can then select dishes to view in AR and easily make purchases from a single hand held service. Data is shown visibly beside AR food in the app, displaying the names of the dish as well as the ratings. This is a visual way to ensure customers get the best food delivery experience possible, combining convenience with satisfaction.
